A "client" has approached you and asked you to help them build a web presence. They are a local Thai restaurant called Majestic Thai. They don't know anything about the Internet, but they know they need a web page. They want an interactive menu that displays all of their food choices with prices, descriptions, etc. They also want the customer to be able to select menu items and create an order with a total price. When the user saves the order, it should create a new item on the backend so that the kitchen can process the order. The rest is open ended, so feel free to add any additional functionality you want.

## Notes
- This should be a Backbone app.
- You should probably do crude wireframes first to get an idea of what types of views and models you'll need.
- Then, write out the actual requirements of the app.
- Use Parse for the backend.

# Extra
- Create another page (e.g. admin.html) that gives the owner the ability to view the orders and "complete" them.
- If you want to look up Backbone validation, create a modal contact form that validates the input and saves the information to a contact list.
- We'll cover authentication with Firebase next week, but if you want to look it up yourself, make the user log in to view the admin page.
